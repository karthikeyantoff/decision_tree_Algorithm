📌 About the Project

This project uses a Decision Tree model trained on a smart home energy dataset to predict energy consumption patterns.

Decision Trees are intuitive, tree-structured models that split data based on feature values, making them easy to interpret and highly effective for both classification and regression tasks.

The Streamlit application provides a simple, interactive interface where users can input smart home parameters and instantly get prediction results.

The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
